Strong Points of the "Link And IP Loop" Project

1. Multi-functional Networking Tool
"Link And IP Loop" combines four powerful features into one script: URL reloader, IP:Port connector, high-speed host flood tester, and a basic people search function—making it a versatile toolkit for both developers and cybersecurity enthusiasts.

2. Language Support
The script supports multiple languages (English, Russian, Persian) from the start, allowing a broader range of users to interact with it easily.

3. Fully Termux-Compatible
It is designed to work seamlessly in Termux on Android devices. The installer auto-configures necessary packages, folders, and permissions, making it beginner-friendly and fast to deploy.

4. User-Customizable Options
Each feature allows the user to control speed, duration, and targets—giving flexibility to adapt for different testing scenarios.

5. Offline Installer + GitHub Integration
The project includes both a .zip installer and a GitHub-based setup, allowing users to choose how they want to install and update the tool.

6. Lightweight and Fast
The script uses Bash and standard Termux tools like curl, nc, and ssh, ensuring it runs fast and doesn’t require heavy resources.

7. Easy to Expand
The modular structure of the script makes it simple to add future features like proxies, logs, or additional search sources.
