ðŸ”¹ Option 1: Reopen a URL repeatedly

User sets URL, speed (seconds), and optional pause time (minutes).

The script opens the URL repeatedly using termux-open-url.



---

ðŸ”¹ Option 2: Repeated connect to IP and port

User inputs IP and port.

Sets speed (delay in seconds).

Script tries connecting (via TCP) continuously without pause.



---

ðŸ”¹ Option 3: Reopen IP:Port, Host:Port, or Subdomain:Port VERY FAST

User enters IP/host/subdomain + port.

The script sends extremely fast connections (like a flood/ping).

Goal: Fast repeated access simulation â€” using either:

curl, wget, or nc (netcat)

or /dev/tcp for low overhead




---

ðŸ”¹ Option 4: Person Finder

User provides first name + last name

Script performs internet search using various search engines or APIs (as much as possible from Termux)

Goal: Give back info about the person from public data
