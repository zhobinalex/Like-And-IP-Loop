To clarify, youâ€™ve shared a GitHub file URL:  
https://github.com/zhobinalex/Soorino-/blob/main/README.md

And asked:  
"Please merge all and complete send here"

Could you specify what you want to merge?  
- Are you asking to merge the contents of all scripts/configs I provided above with the README?
- Do you want a complete, single Bash script for Termux setup, including all features described above, placed here so you can copy it?
- Or do you want something else merged (e.g., contents from multiple files in the repo)?

Please clarify your intent so I can provide exactly what you need.
